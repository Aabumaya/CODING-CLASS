## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

I chose it because it was about American license plates and how it use to look like.
### Core Webpages

The user will be able to search the state to see how old the license plate of that state looks like
### Design Choices

There will be search bar for states and after the user search any state they want they will be able to see the plate and more information about it. I would use white background color and have the text in Blue

Describe your data structure with rationale: States, images, and some information about the license plates like the years and how they are formatted.
